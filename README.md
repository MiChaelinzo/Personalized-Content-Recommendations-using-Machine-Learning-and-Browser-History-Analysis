# Personalized-Content-Recommendations-using-Machine-Learning-and-Browser-History-Analysis
This project is a web extension or application that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze text and provide users with personalized content recommendations based on their browsing history. The extension monitors the user's browsing history, preprocesses it using techniques like cleaning, stemming, and tokenization, and generates a user profile. Using the user profile, the extension selects documents that have high cosine similarity scores with the user's profile and recommends them to the user. This project leverages the power of machine learning and natural language processing to deliver personalized content recommendations that reflect the user's interests and preferences.
